## üß± Entity Models

- **Vehicle Entity**: The central entity representing individual vehicles with their specifications including manufacturer, model, vehicle type, fuel type, engine type, and year of manufacture.
- **FuelData Entity**: Records individual fuel consumption entries linked to specific vehicles, tracking liters used, distance traveled in kilometers, and timestamp of the entry.
- **EngineData Entity**: Captures engine performance metrics linked to specific vehicles, including RPM measurements, temperature readings, and timestamp of the recording.
